Stata to R (and vice versa) conversion
======================================

This project aims to provide simple code fragments for everyday data analysis
tasks in Stata and in R. The ultimate goal is to make conversion between the
two software packages easier.

The inspiration for this project is the [Data Analysis Examples](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/dae/)
website made by the Statistical Consulting Group at UCLA.
