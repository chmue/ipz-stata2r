Stata to R (and vice versa) conversion
======================================

This project aims to provide simple code fragments for everyday data analysis
tasks in Stata and in R. The ultimate goal is to make conversion between the
two software packages easier.

The inspiration for this project is the [Data Analysis Examples](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/dae/)
website made by the Statistical Consulting Group at UCLA. 

Structure and naming conventions
--------------------------------

The tasks are structured in the following four categories:

1. Reading/writing data
2. Data munging (recoding/cleaning)
3. Computing statistical models
4. Presenting results

There is a "standalone" and a "short" example for each task. The standalone
example contains all the necessary commands to run the example (reading 
data, loading addons, etc.). The short example is just the code for the
specific task (the standalone code without preparatory/unrelated steps).

The standalone code can be in the Rmd format. This allows for nicer
explanations of what the code does than comments in the script files.

The file naming follows the scheme:

* adding-vars.{do,md}
* adding-vars-short.do
* adding-vars.{r,Rmd}
* addings-vars-short.r
